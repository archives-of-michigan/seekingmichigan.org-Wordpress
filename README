Here lies the theme and plugins used for the Wordpress portion of seekingmichigan.org.

Installation:
* Copy the theme directory to /<wordpress_installation>/wp-content/themes/<name>
* Copy each directory under plugins to /<wordpress_installation>/wp-content/plugins/

These templates require the seekingmichigan.org-ContentDM project be installed on a ContentDM server. 
You can find that at http://github.com/dkastner/seekingmichigan.org-ContentDM

Editing a file on github should update the server.

(This is a minor edit for purposes of demonstrating Git.)
