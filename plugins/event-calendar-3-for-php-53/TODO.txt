TODO: Event Calendar 3.1.4
==========================

 ? Fix XML entity rendering on Safari (works on IE/Firefox)

 o Include an example of how to make events show up differently from other
   categories.

 o Next/Prev links on single post page may link to an event post, even
   in advanced mode, when such posts won't show up on the front page.
   (Reported by Gerjan Boer)
 
 o Events in calendar popup not listed in time order. Popup shows start time
   every day for multi-day events.
   (Reported by Craig Rothman)

Event List:

 o Provide better example CSS. (Include it in ec3.css).

FUTURE
======

 o Multiple event categories.
   With colour-coding for each category.
   Export each category as a separate iCalendar.

 o Fix category count.
   Templates that show the number of posts in each category will not
   always show the correct number for the event category. In advanced mode,
   expired events are not listed in the cat page, but they would be included in
   this count.
 
 o Allow import of a public iCalendar.

 o Repeating events (create upcoming ones in a batch job, triggered every so
   often?)
 
 o Consider upcoming.org integration.

 o Whole-page calendar.
   Some people want a HUGE calendar, not in the sidebar. This doesn't
   work well if they have a sidebar calendar as well, because the calendar
   has a unique ID. Should probably allow a new id to be set in the
   ec3_get_calendar() template function.
   (See also, the next item...)
 
 o New template function to list event titles inside the calendar table.
   Like this: http://www.writingsalons.com/classes/index-12.php
   Make sure that all the links work properly, even w/o JavaScript.

 o 'Calendar-Page'-formatting template. Alternative to ec3_the_schedule().
   Suggested by Karl Kolk.

Event List:

 o Option to show N days in advance, rather than N next events.

 o Possibly: break the function into its component parts, and enable folks to
   generate the contents with their own loop - and then provide an example loop
   in get_events().

   That's a good idea. It should be straightforward to add start and end
   dates to the template code for the ec3_get_events() function.

 o customize display of listing (instead of just ul ) [heather]

 o month headings/grouping (like it does with posts on same day) [heather]

 ? Fix bug where event is also in another category -> multiple tooltips.
   -> Can't reproduce this now.

 x Deal with local timezones correctly.

 x Document ?ec3_today ?ec3_days=N ?ec3_from=DATE ?ec3_before=DATE listing
   options. Nobody knows about them!

 x Promote ec3_get_events()
